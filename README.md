### Tl;dr (too long didn't read) please consider these 3 simple suggestions 
*Be skeptical of everything you receive via SMS, email, or voice. If you actually beleive your bank is contacting you... politely hang up / disregard message and call your bank directly to confirm it's legit... This applies to all incoming messages... 

*Enable 'multi factor authentication/2FA' when possible. You'll be more secure having MFA enabled when YOU login... bonus - if someone attempts to login to your account YOU will know about it in real time. (Multi-Factor = something you KNOW, ARE, and/or HAVE. Know = password, Are = biometric, Have = mobile device)

*Use a password manager. Choose one that has a good reputation... Use complex passwords. Never use the same password. 

# Now... lets go down the rabbit hole of keeping you secure
